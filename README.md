Using clustering algorithm for customer segmentation (Unsupervised learning)

In this project, I tackled the challenge of working with unlabeled data, often referred to as unlabeled data, by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques to identify underlying patterns and similarities. The primary objective was to develop a clustering algorithm capable of revealing natural groupings within the provided unlabeled dataset. By uncovering these clusters, the algorithm has the potential to unveil the hidden structure of the data and facilitate the discovery of valuable insights.

This project's real-world relevance is evident in its application to understanding customer behaviour, a critical aspect for businesses of all sizes. Since customer data is typically unlabeled, clustering techniques prove invaluable in uncovering hidden groups or patterns within this data. Leveraging the provided dataset, I followed a systematic approach:

## Data Exploration 
I conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics and to extract meaningful insights.

## PCA (Principal Component Analysis) 
Employing dimensionality reduction through PCA, I optimized the dataset for clustering.

## Cluster Identification 
To determine the appropriate number of clusters, I utilized the elbow plot and silhouette plot, ensuring the robustness of the clustering process.

## Distance Analysis 
I visualized the nearest neighbour distances to assess the potential for employing DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering.

## Clustering Algorithms
I implemented a range of clustering algorithms, including K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, and Agglomerative clustering, to identify natural groupings within the data.

## Result Analysis 
Finally, I analyzed the outcomes of these clustering algorithms to draw meaningful conclusions and extract valuable insights from the data.
